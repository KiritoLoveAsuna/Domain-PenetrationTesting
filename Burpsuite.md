###### Benefit for iphone installing burp CA certificate
>Burp Suite is a popular tool used for web application security testing. It can be used to intercept and analyze network traffic between a client and a server. When you install Burp Suiteâ€™s CA certificate on your iPhone, it allows Burp Suite to intercept HTTPS traffic between your iPhone and the server1. This is because the CA certificate is used to establish a secure connection between the client and the server. By installing the CA certificate, you are essentially telling your iPhone to trust Burp Suite as a trusted certificate authority. This allows Burp Suite to decrypt the HTTPS traffic and analyze it for security vulnerabilities2
